Social Media Sentiment Analysis is a Python-based project developed in Jupyter Notebook that analyzes and visualizes sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics, events, or brands. By collecting and preprocessing social media text data (such as tweets), the notebook applies natural language processing techniques to clean the text, perform tokenization, and classify sentiment using libraries like TextBlob or VADER. It then visualizes sentiment trends through word clouds, sentiment distribution plots, and time-based sentiment tracking to uncover meaningful insights. This project is ideal for students, data enthusiasts, and professionals interested in NLP, data visualization, and understanding public engagement. Built with reproducibility and clarity in mind, the notebook is open-source and suitable for educational and analytical use cases.
